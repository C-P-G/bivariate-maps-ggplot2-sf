# Bivariate maps with ggplot2 and sf

<!-- <img src="https://timogrossenbacher.ch/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/csi-visualize-interpolation-1.png" width="100%" /> -->

The above map shows income (in-)equality in Switzerland on the municipality level by visualizing two variables at the same time: [the Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), and average income (in Swiss Francs). It uses a so-called bivariate color scale, blending two different color scales into one. Lastly, it uses the beautiful relief depicting the mountainous Swiss landscape. Here we're going to show you how to produce such a map *exclusively with R*.

For this blog post, I worked together with my colleague [Angelo Zehr](https://twitter.com/angelozehr), who recently published a [nice bivariate thematic map](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/interaktive-karte-so-ungleich-ist-das-einkommen-in-der-schweiz-verteilt) comparing income equality and average income in Switzerland. We took this opportunity to give a major update of my post on [thematic maps with ggplot2](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/) which is more than two years old, but still attracts hundreds of visits each week. What has changed since then?

* With the `sf` packacke and its integration into `ggplot2` through the `geom_sf()` function, it is now even easier to quickly create thematic maps.
* In this post, we not only show how to produce a univariate map (with one variable displayed) but also a bivariate map, where two variables are displayed at the same time – using one visual variable (or aesthetic in `ggplot2` terms) only, namely the "fill" variable. As said above, this works by blending two color scales together.

## Outline

This tutorial is structured as follows:

* Read in the thematic data and geodata (no preprocessing required) and join them.
* Define a general map theme.
* Create a univariate thematic map ("choropleth") showing the average income. This largely draws from [the previous blog post](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only) and involves techniques for custom color classes and advanced aesthetics.
* Create a bivariate thematic map (also a "choropleth") showing average income and income (in-)equality at the same time.

Let's go! 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# CONFIG
user_name <- "grssnbchr" # your Git username (only needed if
# you want to deploy to GH pages)
project_name <- "bivariate-maps-ggplot2-sf" # adapt!
package_date <- "2019-03-01" # date of the CRAN snapshot that
# the checkpoint package uses
R_version <- "3.5.2" # R-Version to use
options(Ncpus = 4) # use 4 cores for parallelized installation of packages
if (R_version != paste0(version$major, ".", version$minor)){
  stop("ERROR: specified R version does not match currently used.")
}
```

## Reproducibility

As always, you can reproduce, reuse and remix everything you find here, just go to [this repository](https://github.com/grssnbchr/`r project_name`) and clone it. All the needed input files are in the `input` folder, and the main file to execute is `index.Rmd`. Right now, knitting it produces an `index.md` that I use for my blog post on [timogrossenbacher.ch](https://timogrossenbacher.ch), but you can adapt the script to produce an HTML file, too. The PNGs produced herein are saved to `wp-content/uploads/2019/04` so I can display them directly in my blog, but of course you can also adjust this.


### GitHub

The code for the herein described process can also be freely downloaded from [https://github.com/`r user_name`/`r project_name`](https://github.com/`r user_name`/`r project_name`).

### Version information

This report was generated on `r Sys.time()`. R version: `r paste0(version$major, ".", version$minor)` on `r version$platform`. For this report, CRAN packages as of `r package_date` were used.

## Preparations

### Clear workspace and install necessary packages

What follows from here until the section **Load Data** is just my usual routine: Detach all packages, remove all variables in the global environment, etc, and then load the packages from the MRAN server (a snapshot from March 1st, 2019). With this, I ensure [reproducibility and cross-device compatibility](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2017/07/a-truly-reproducible-r-workflow/). I use my [freely available template](https://github.com/grssnbchr/rddj-template) for this, with some adaptions detailed under **Reproducibility**.

```{r preparations, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    out.width = "100%",
    dpi = 300,
    fig.width = 8,
    fig.height = 6,
    fig.path = 'https://timogrossenbacher.ch/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bm-',
    strip.white = T,
    dev = "png",
    dev.args = list(png = list(bg = "#f5f5f2"))
)


detach_all_packages <- function() {
  basic_packages_blank <-  c("stats",
                             "graphics",
                             "grDevices",
                             "utils",
                             "datasets",
                             "methods",
                             "base")
  basic_packages <- paste("package:", basic_packages_blank, sep = "")

  package_list <- search()[
    ifelse(unlist(gregexpr("package:", search())) == 1, TRUE, FALSE)]

  package_list <- setdiff(package_list, basic_packages)

  if (length(package_list) > 0)  for (package in package_list) {
    detach(package, character.only = TRUE, unload = TRUE)
    print(paste("package ", package, " detached", sep = ""))
  }
}

detach_all_packages()

# this allows multiple persons to use the same RMarkdown
# without adjusting the working directory by themselves all the time
source("scripts/csf.R")
path_to_wd <- csf() # if this - for some reason - does not work,
# replace with a hardcoded path, like so: "~/projects/rddj-template/analysis/"
if ( is.null(path_to_wd) | !dir.exists(path_to_wd)) {
  print("WARNING: No working directory specified for current user")
} else {
  setwd(path_to_wd)
}

# suppress scientific notation
options(scipen = 999)

# unload global rstudioapi and knitr again to avoid conflicts with checkpoint
# this is only necessary if executed within RStudio
# outside of RStudio, namely in the knit.sh script, this causes RMarkdown
# rendering to fail, thus should not be executed there
if (Sys.getenv("RSTUDIO") == "1"){
  detach_all_packages()
}
```

### Define packages

For this project, we just used the usual suspects, i.e. `tidyverse` packages including `ggplot2` for plotting, `sf` for geodata processing and `raster` for working with (spatial) raster data, i.e. the relief. Also, the `viridis` package imports the beautiful Viridis color scale we use for the univariate map.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# from https://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/web/packages/checkpoint/vignettes/using-checkpoint-with-knitr.html
# if you don't need a package, remove it from here (commenting is probably not sufficient)
cat("
library(rstudioapi)
library(tidyverse) # ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble
library(magrittr) # pipes
library(lintr) # code linting
library(sf) # spatial data handling
library(raster) # raster handling (needed for relief)
library(viridis) # viridis color scale
library(cowplot) # stack ggplots
library(rmarkdown)",
file = "manifest.R")
```

### Install packages

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# if checkpoint is not yet installed, install it (for people using this
# system for the first time)
if (!require(checkpoint)) {
  if (!require(devtools)) {
    install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    require(devtools)
  }
  devtools::install_github("RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint",
                           ref = "v0.3.2", # could be adapted later,
                           # as of now (beginning of July 2017
                           # this is the current release on CRAN)
                           repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  require(checkpoint)
}
# nolint start
if (!dir.exists("~/.checkpoint")) {
  dir.create("~/.checkpoint")
}
# nolint end
# install packages for the specified CRAN snapshot date
checkpoint(snapshotDate = package_date,
           project = path_to_wd,
           verbose = T,
           scanForPackages = T,
           use.knitr = F,
           R.version = R_version)
rm(package_date)
```


### Load packages

Here the packages are actually loaded. From the `sessionInfo()` output you can see the exact version numbers of packages used herein.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("manifest.R")
unlink("manifest.R")
sessionInfo()
```

## Data Sources

### Thematic Data

Here the thematic data to be visualized is loaded. It is contained in a CSV consisting of columns:

* "municipality (name)", 
* "bfs_id" (ID to match with geodata), 
* "mean" (average income in the municipality)
* "gini" (the Gini index for income (in-)equality)

The data provider in this case is the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, where the original data (as an Excel) can be [downloaded from](https://www.estv.admin.ch/dam/estv/de/dokumente/allgemein/Dokumentation/Zahlen_fakten/Steuerstatistiken/direkte_bundessteuer/np_statistische_kennzahlen_ohne/NP_2015_mitnull.xlsx.download.xlsx/NP_2015_mitnull.xlsx). The columns used were "mean_reinka" and "gini_reinka" for "mean" and "gini" (in the "Gemeinden - Communes" tab), respectively. See the first tabs in the Excel for a short explanation. Find additional explanations on [the SFTA website (German)](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/de/home/allgemein/steuerstatistiken/fachinformationen/steuerstatistiken/direkte-bundessteuer.html), especially in [this PDF](https://www.estv.admin.ch/dam/estv/de/dokumente/allgemein/Dokumentation/Zahlen_fakten/Steuerstatistiken/direkte_bundessteuer/np_statistische_kennzahlen_ohne/Einleitung.pdf.download.pdf/1-Einleitung_NP_d.pdf).

We used the year 2015 as it is the youngest in the available time series.

```{r read data, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("input/data.csv")
``` 

### Geodata

Various geodata from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office and the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo) depicting Swiss borders as of 2015 are used herein.

* `input/gde-1-1-15.*`: These geometries do not show the political borders of Swiss municipalities, but the so-called "productive" area, i.e., larger lakes and other "unproductive" areas such as mountains are excluded. This has two advantages: 1) The relatively sparsely populated but very large municipalities in the Alps don't have too much visual weight and 2) it allows us to use the beautiful raster relief of the Alps as a background. The data are also from the FSO, but not freely available. I was allowed to republish the Shapefile for this educational purpose (also included in the `input` folder). Please stick to that policy.
* `input/g2*`: National (`s`) as well as cantonal borders (`k`) and lakes (`l`). Available [here](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/dienstleistungen/geostat/geodaten-bundesstatistik/administrative-grenzen/generalisierte-gemeindegrenzen.html).
* (Hillshaded) relief: This is a freely available GeoTIFF from [the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (swisstopo)](https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/products/maps/national/digital/srm1000). For the sake of simplicity, it was converted to the "ESRI ASCII" format using ` gdal_translate -of AAIGrid 02-relief-georef.tif 02-relief-ascii.asc` on the CLI. The `raster` can read that format natively, without the need of explicitly installing the `rgdal` package – which is not the case for GeoTIFF files.


```{r read in geodata, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# read cantonal borders
canton_geo <- read_sf("input/g2k15.shp")

# read country borders
country_geo <- read_sf("input/g2l15.shp")

# read lakes
lake_geo <- read_sf("input/g2s15.shp")

# read productive area (2324 municipalities)
municipality_prod_geo <- read_sf("input/gde-1-1-15.shp")

# read in raster of relief
relief <- raster("input/02-relief-ascii.asc") %>%
  # hide relief outside of Switzerland by masking with country borders
  mask(country_geo) %>%
  as("SpatialPixelsDataFrame") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rename(value = layer)

# clean up
rm(country_geo)
```


### Join Geodata with Thematic Data

In the following chunk, the municipality geodata is extended (joined) with the thematic data over each municipality's unique identifier, so we end up with a data frame consisting of the income data as well as the geometries. Note that the class of this resulting object is still `sf` as well as `data.frame`.

```{r join data into shapefiles, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
municipality_prod_geo %<>%
  left_join(data, by = c("BFS_ID" = "bfs_id"))
class(municipality_prod_geo)
```

## Define a Map Theme

We first define a unique theme for the map, e.g. remove all axes, add a subtle grid (that you might not be able to see on a bright screen) etc. We mostly took this from [a previous blog post](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2018/03/categorical-spatial-interpolation-with-r/). 

```{r define clean theme, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
theme_map <- function(...) {
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Ubuntu Regular", color = "#22211d"),
    # remove all axes
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    # add a subtle grid
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "#ebebe5", size = 0.2),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    # background colors
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA), 
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA), 
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#f5f5f2", color = NA),
    # borders and margins
    plot.margin = unit(c(.5, .5, .2, .5), "cm"),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.spacing = unit(c(-.1, 0.2, .2, 0.2), "cm"),
    # titles
    legend.title = element_text(size = 13),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0, color = "#4e4d47"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = "#4e4d47"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, color = "#4e4d47", 
                                 margin = margin(b = -0.1, 
                                                 t = -0.1, 
                                                 l = 2, 
                                                 unit = "cm"), 
                                 debug = F),
    # captions
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, 
                                # hjust = .5, 
                                margin = margin(t = 0.2, 
                                                b = 0, 
                                                unit = "cm"), 
                                color = "#939184"),
    ...
  )
}
```

## Create a Univariate Choropleth

First, let's create a standard (univariate) choropleth map based on the average income alone ("mean" variable). Beware: Rendering the relief takes some time!

Without going into much detail, this is basically the same process as in the old blog post, detailed in the [respective section](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/#discrete-classes-with-quantile-scale), just using `sf` instead of `sp`.

1. We first calculate quantiles from the average income to form 6 different classes of average income (quantiles are used so each color class contains approximately the same amount of municipalities). From this, we generate a new variable "mean_quantiles" which is actually visualized on the map. We also generate custom labels for the classes.

2. We generate the `ggplot2` object as follows:

* Specify the data source and the main fill aesthetic (the visual variable showing the average income per municipality).
* Add the Viridis color scale with the correct number of classes.
* Add the relief through a call to `geom_raster()`.
* Add a truncated alpha scale for the relief, as the "fill" aesthetic is already taken (refer to [this section](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2016/12/beautiful-thematic-maps-with-ggplot2-only/#relief) for an explanation).
* Use `geom_sf()` without an additional data argument to visualize municipal borders.
* Use two more `geom_sf()` calls to add cantonal borders and lakes stemming from the `canton_geo` and `lake_geo` datasets, respectively.
* Specify our previously defined map theme.
* Add titles and subtitles.

```{r thematic-univariate-map, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# define number of classes
no_classes <- 6
labels <- c()

# extract quantiles
quantiles <- municipality_prod_geo %>% 
  pull(mean) %>%
  quantile(probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = no_classes + 1))

# here we define custom labels (the default ones would be ugly)
labels <- c()
for(idx in 1:length(quantiles)){
  labels <- c(labels, paste0(round(quantiles[idx] / 1000, 0), 
                             "k",
                             " – ", 
                             round(quantiles[idx + 1] / 1000, 0),
                             "k CHF"))
}

# we need to remove the last label 
# because that would be something like "478k - NA"
labels <- labels[1:length(labels) - 1]

# here we actually create a new 
# variable on the dataset with the quantiles
municipality_prod_geo %<>% 
  mutate(mean_quantiles = cut(mean, 
                               breaks = quantiles, 
                               labels = labels, 
                               include.lowest = T))

ggplot(
  # define data and aesthetic mapping, which is just the fill
  data = municipality_prod_geo
) +
  # use the Viridis color scale
  # the discrete-option is used, 
  # and we use guide_legend instead of guide_colourbar
  scale_fill_viridis(
    option = "magma",
    name = "Average income",
    alpha = 0.8, # make fill a bit brighter
    begin = 0.1, # this option seems to be new (compared to 2016): 
    # with this we can truncate the 
    # color scale, so tht extreme colors (very dark and very bright) are not
    # used, which makes the map a bit more beautiful
    end = 0.9,
    discrete = T,
    direction = 1, # dark is lowest, yellow is highest
    guide = guide_legend(
     keyheight = unit(5, units = "mm"),
     title.position = 'top',
     reverse = T # display highest income on top
  )) +
  # first: draw the relief
  # geom_raster(
  #   data = relief,
  #   inherit.aes = FALSE,
  #   aes(
  #     x = x,
  #     y = y,
  #     alpha = value
  #   )
  # ) +
  # use the "alpha hack" (as the "fill" aesthetic is already taken)
  scale_alpha(name = "", range = c(0.6, 0), guide = F)  +
  # use thin white stroke for municipality borders
  geom_sf(
    mapping = aes(fill = mean_quantiles),
    color = "white",
    size = 0.1
  ) +
  # use thicker white stroke for cantonal borders
  geom_sf(
    data = canton_geo,
    fill = "transparent",
    color = "white",
    size = 0.5
  ) +
  # draw lakes in light blue
  geom_sf(
    data = lake_geo,
    fill = "#D6F1FF",
    color = "transparent"
  ) +
  # add theme
  theme_map() +
  # add titles
  labs(x = NULL, 
         y = NULL, 
         title = "Switzerland's regional income", 
         subtitle = "Average income in Swiss municipalities, 2015", 
         caption = "Map CC-BY-SA\nAuthors: Timo Grossenbacher (@grssnbchr), Angelo Zehr (@angelozehr)\nGeometries: ThemaKart BFS and swisstopo; Data: ESTV, 2015")

```

## Create a Bivariate Choropleth

In this last section, we finally create the bivariate map. For this, we first specify a bivariate color scale, using an external tool to find out the appropriate color values. Then we draw the map with basically the same logic as for the univariate map. We also come up with a possible design of a legend and that to the overall plot in the end.

### Create the Bivariate Color Scale

[Joshua Stevens](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/) describes very well how to create the color codes for a sequential bivariate color scheme. He also gives some background on readability and accessibility of such maps and thus we refrain from discussing these points here. Our blog post is intended to remain purely technical, also for the sake of space and reading time.

Using the Sketch software we combined three rectangles with fill blue (base color #1E8CE3) and red (base color #C91024) each with three different opacities (20%, 50%, 80%) and blend mode "multiply", which resulted in the 3 * 3 = 9 hex values specified manually below. Side note: If somebody comes up with a handy way of "blending" hex values in R, or even knows a package for that, please notify us in the comments. A bit more of automation would be nice.

By the way, this GIF from Joshua's blog shows the process of blending the two scales in an awesome fashion:

<img src="http://www.joshuastevens.net/images/js_bivariateMix.gif" width="100%" />

```{r prepare bivariate color scale with pretty breaks, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# create 3 buckets for gini
quantiles_gini <- data %>% 
  pull(gini) %>% 
  quantile(probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 4))

# output for inspection
quantiles_gini

# create 3 buckets for mean income
quantiles_mean <- data %>% 
  pull(mean) %>% 
  quantile(probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 4))

# output for inspection
quantiles_mean

# pretty breaks
# based on the values above, we manually define the breaks in a more human
# readable way by rounding
pretty_breaks_gini <- c(0, 0.4, 0.45, 1)
pretty_breaks_mean <- c(0, 35000, 40000, 1000000)

# create color scale that encodes two variables
# red for gini and blue for mean income
# the special notation with gather is due to readibility reasons
bivariate_color_scale <- tibble(
  "3 - 3" = "#3F2949", # high inequality, high income
  "2 - 3" = "#435786",
  "1 - 3" = "#4885C1", # low inequality, high income
  "3 - 2" = "#77324C",
  "2 - 2" = "#806A8A", # medium inequality, medium income
  "1 - 2" = "#89A1C8",
  "3 - 1" = "#AE3A4E", # high inequality, low income
  "2 - 1" = "#BC7C8F",
  "1 - 1" = "#CABED0" # low inequality, low income
) %>%
  gather("group", "fill")

```


### Join Color Codes Into Data

Here the municipalities are put into the appropriate class corresponding to their average income and income inequality.

```{r join color codes bivariate, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# cut into groups defined above and join fill
municipality_prod_geo %<>%
  mutate(
    gini_quantiles = cut(
      gini,
      # you could also use the quantiles with unrounded values: quantiles_gini
      breaks = pretty_breaks_gini,
      include.lowest = TRUE
    ),
    mean_quantiles = cut(
      mean,
      # you could also use the quantiles with unrounded values: quantiles_mean
      breaks = pretty_breaks_mean,
      include.lowest = TRUE
    ),
    # by pasting the factors together as numbers we match the groups defined
    # in the tibble bivariate_color_scale
    group = paste(
      as.numeric(gini_quantiles), "-",
      as.numeric(mean_quantiles)
    )
  ) %>%
  # we now join the actual hex values per "group"
  # so each municipality knows its hex value based on the his gini and avg 
  # income value
  left_join(bivariate_color_scale, by = "group")

```

### Draw the Map

As said above, this is basically the same approach as above. What's special here is the 

```{r thematic bivariate map, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
map <- ggplot(
  municipality_prod_geo,
  aes(
    fill = fill
  )
) +
  # first: draw the relief
  # geom_raster(
  #   data = relief,
  #   inherit.aes = FALSE,
  #   aes(
  #     x = x,
  #     y = y,
  #     alpha = value
  #   )
  # ) +
  # use the "alpha hack"
  scale_alpha(name = "", range = c(0.6, 0), guide = F)  +
  # use thin white stroke for municipalities
  geom_sf(
    color = "white",
    size = 0.1
  ) +
  # as the sf object municipality_prod_geo has a colum with name fill that
  # contains the hex code for each municipality, we can use scale_fill_identity
  scale_fill_identity() +
  # use thicker white stroke for cantons
  geom_sf(
    data = canton_geo,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    fill = "transparent",
    color = "white",
    size = 0.5
  ) +
  # draw lakes in light blue
  geom_sf(
    data = lake_geo,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    fill = "#D6F1FF",
    color = "transparent"
  ) +
  theme_map() +
  geom_curve(
    aes(
      x = 772460,
      xend = 731300,
      y = 229782,
      yend = 240300
    ),
    size = 0.2,
    curvature = -0.2,
    arrow = arrow(
      length = unit(0.005, "npc")
    )
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(
      x = 772460,
      y = 229782
    ),
    nudge_x = 3000,
    hjust = 0,
    label = "Grey areas mean low\nincome but also low\ninequality",
    size = 3
  ) +
  # add titles
  labs(x = NULL, 
         y = NULL, 
         title = "Switzerland's regional income inequality", 
         subtitle = "Average income and income inequality in Swiss municipalities, 2015", 
         caption = "Map CC-BY-SA\nAuthors: Timo Grossenbacher (@grssnbchr), Angelo Zehr (@angelozehr)\nGeometries: ThemaKart BFS and swisstopo; Data: ESTV, 2015")
```

### Draw the Legend

For the legend we use the `geom_tile()` geometry of `ggplot2`. Before that, we have to quickly transform the `bivariate_color_scale` data frame, which contains all the hex values for all combinations of average income and income inequality classes.

```{r bivariate-legend, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# separate the groups
bivariate_color_scale %<>%
  separate(group, into = c("gini", "mean"), sep = " - ") %>% 
  mutate(gini = as.integer(gini),
         mean = as.integer(mean))

legend <- ggplot() +
  geom_tile(
    data = bivariate_color_scale,
    mapping = aes(
      x = gini,
      y = mean,
      fill = fill)
  ) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  labs(x = "Higher inequality ⟶️",
       y = "Higher income ⟶️") +
  theme_map() +
  # make font small enough
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 4),
  ) +
  # quadratic tiles
  coord_fixed()
```

### Combine Map and Legend

Here we just combine the legend with the map using the `cowplot` packag. It allows to specify the exact position of plots on the canvas, and scaling the width and height of plots (as we do with the legend). It would have been nice to rotate the legend plot by 45° but we didn't find a way how to do this. 

The numeric arguments to `draw_plot()` are basically trial and error.

```{r thematic-bivariate-map-with-legend}
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(map, 0, 0, 1, 1) +
  draw_plot(legend, 0.15, 0.05, 0.2, 0.2)
```

## Linting

The code in this RMarkdown is listed with the [lintr package](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr), which is based on the  [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/). 

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lintr::lint("index.Rmd")
```
